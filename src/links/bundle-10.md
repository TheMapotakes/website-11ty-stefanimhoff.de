- [Welcome to the Second Enlightenment](https://newdiscourses.com/2021/10/welcome-to-the-second-enlightenment/) was, without doubt, the best podcast I‚Äôve listened to in 2021. James Lindsay explains in nearly 1.5 hours why we stand at a crossroads between a new enlightenment or a dark age. He lays down a cohesive and with abundant examples reasoned argument that explains the behavior we see in the last years of traditional gate-keepers. üïØ It‚Äôs worth investing in listening to this episode!

- [Ben Shapiro](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0jeW0f0GalsN2xdHB0MJEZ?si=4oeQykcnRd-BW_7rbdXDKg) was a guest on _The Joe Rogan Experience_. He‚Äôs the only person, I can‚Äôt listen to at 1.5√ó speed because he talks so fast.
