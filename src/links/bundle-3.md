- [Jupiter‚Äôs Legacy](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/93484-jupiter-s-legacy) {% netflix "80244953" %} is a new superhero TV Show that is much better than the rating would suggest. I‚Äôm honestly sad that it‚Äôs canceled, I wouldn‚Äôt even have noticed wasn‚Äôt there the short episode [Jupiter‚Äôs Legacy Asks Big Questions. Netflix Cancelled It](https://youtu.be/aYZy4Qzqa00) on _Out of Frame_. I bought the {% affiliate "Graphic Novel", "B097BWT8SC" %} to learn how the story continues.
- [Against Environmental Anti-Humanism](https://www.humanprogress.org/against-environmental-anti-humanism/) is an essay by _Marian L. Tupy_ of HumanProgress. There is no reason for pessimism about the future of our species of the planet.
- [The Samurai Genre in Movies](https://youtu.be/OeqA8vaS9-8) explores the culture, history of the Samurai genre in cinema.
- [Drawing Dr. Jordan B. Peterson](https://youtu.be/b4zQcR4VJnQ) is a stunning time-lapse of 86 hours drawing with charcoal and graphite.
- _Bonsai Releaf_ is a new channel documenting the design, pruning, and shaping of bonsai trees. [Restoring a Neglected Chinese Juniper Bonsai](https://youtu.be/fCdXvp0tTnc) and [Transformation of a Japanese Larch Bonsai Tree](https://youtu.be/Xi6gaRoLUYA) are the first two videos. _Summer Rayne Oakes_ released the video [Bonsai Care for Beginners](https://youtu.be/pvg6HCzUz_0). After watching these videos, I want to try again to create Bonsai.
- [Best Lessons Learned from Jordan B. Peterson](https://youtu.be/hJrEaLYacwc) is a collection of the best graphical recordings by _After Skool_ of talks by _Jordan B. Peterson_.
- _Bret Weinstein_ recommended the essay [The Nightmare That Is a Reality](https://wethescreamers.com/) by _Arthur Koestler_ from 1944. It is a shocking essay about the inability of _the screamers_ to reach the majority of people who stay silent in face of evil. Eric Weinstein [discussed the essay](https://wethescreamers.com/essay-discussion/) in his podcast episode [Introducing The Portal Essay Club ‚Äì What if everyone is simply insane?](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563?i=1000487931451). An interesting dive into the psychology of conformity.
- [The Sounds of Space: A sonic adventure to other worlds](https://youtu.be/OeYnV9zp7Dk) is a short film that takes you on a journey back in time and to the edge of our solar system and beyond, to discover what other worlds of sound are lurking beyond Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.
- [Foreign Cinema ‚Äì How To Understand a Country Through Film](https://youtu.be/ZfB_DOaWrPU) is a short film by _Tom van der Linden_ showing his home country _the Netherlands_ by analyzing films of the country.
- Something really worrying happened to _Bret Weinstein_ and _Heather Heying_, both Ph.D. scientists, this month. Bred talked to [Dr. Pierre Kory about the effectiveness of Ivermectin against COVID-19](https://odysee.com/@BretWeinstein:f/COVID-Ivermectin-and-the-Crime-of-the-Century-DarkHorse-Podcast-with-Pierre-Kory-Bret-Weinstein:f). YouTube decided to take down the podcast after it reached nearly 600K views. They also deleted Dr. _Kory‚Äôs_ speech about Ivermectin in front of Congress last year. Two weeks later Bret talked to _Dr. Robert Malone_, the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, and _Steve Kirsch_, a researcher for adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in [How to save the world, in three easy steps](https://odysee.com/@BretWeinstein:f/how-to-save-the-world,-in-three-easy:0). YouTube deleted this podcast after it reached multiple hundred thousand views and threatened Bret and Heather with the removal of their channel. They [de-monetized their channel](https://mobile.twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/1410094816088756225) a week later and removed a big portion of their income. [Dr. Robert Malones LinkedIn account was shut down](https://mobile.twitter.com/rwmalonemd/status/1409943998890917888). We reached a dangerous level of censorship by the Big Tech oligarchs that endangers and kills people because scientists are prevented from talking about serious issues regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and the worrying side-effects of the vaccines. Fortunately, the community of people open to reason helped out. Bret was a guest on multiple podcasts as [Triggernometry](https://youtu.be/sbyIIprV9pE), [Lex Fridman](https://youtu.be/TG6BuSjwP4o) and [Joe Rogan had his first emergency podcast, inviting Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7uVXKgE6eLJKMXkETwcw0D). _Matt Taibbi_ wrote [Meet the Censored: Bret Weinstein](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/meet-the-censored-bret-weinstein) on his Substack. This attention made it possible to reach the left echo chamber. [Bill Maher spoke about the topic on his show](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/560384-bill-maher-slams-tech-giants-for-limiting-covid-19-info-ivermectin-isnt-a). I‚Äôm shocked how unaware and ignorant people are. If you _still_ think politicians and media inform you correctly, you don‚Äôt have any media competency. Multiple studies were released in the last months regarding the [health hazards of masks](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/8/4344) and [the safety of the vaccines](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm). The latter study concluded that we kill 2 people for every 3 people we save with the vaccines. A society that sacrifices young and healthy people to save old people is doomed. I encourage everybody to look into the [European database of suspected adverse drug reactions](https://www.adrreports.eu/en/search_subst.html) (press ‚ÄúC‚Äù, scroll to ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù) which lists for the first 5 months of vaccinations in Europe **600,000** adverse side effects, **50 % serious** (the estimated rate of reporting is 3 %)! At this rate, over 1 Million Europeans will be damaged by the vaccines at the end of the year.
- I bought a [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) to store my cryptocurrencies safely and discovered the interesting course [School of Block](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6VM0N695IhnurbIjBTwzQ3cSeXvBJeJj) that teaches knowledge around blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
- _Erik Voorhees_, the founder of ShapeShift (a cryptocurrencies exchange) was interviewed on Reason: [Governments Can't Stop Bitcoin 'Despite All Their Guns and Weapons‚Äô](https://youtu.be/b36hvsEMznU).
- Comedian _JP Sears_ perfected his anti-woke comedy lately. He mocked the [woke military](https://youtu.be/QL0u8JmfRU0), [trans athletes competing against biological women](https://youtu.be/7GZbdSiGdBc), [the woke Victoria‚Äôs Secret](https://youtu.be/9ZJp7eL79ic), and [Antifa](https://youtu.be/JG46ktmynpE).
- Brave released their [own search](https://search.brave.com/) in Beta. Unbiased, privacy-preserving, and independent. I love what Brave is building.
- I discovered a song from Tom MacDonald, released in 2020: [No Response](https://youtu.be/gSwMdWzaaqM). An impressive rap, with nearly six minutes of continuous brilliant rhymes. Tom surpassed Eminem in brilliance and skill in my opinion.
- I love how rap artists use their voices to question and fight against the overreach of governments, instead of rapping about drugs, guns, or sex. _Phizzo_ is a German Rapper I saw once before in the song [Ich Mach Da Nicht Mehr Mit](https://odysee.com/@rapbellionsgermany:5/ICH-MACH-DA-NICHT-MIT-1080P-HD:9). üá©üá™ He released now a funny and clever rap song against the German government‚Äôs overreach: [Reicht B√ºrger](https://youtu.be/P_sMjnWE_LQ). üá©üá™
- _Jordan B. Peterson_ talked to _Andrew Doyle_ about [Free Speech and the Satirical Activist](https://youtu.be/aoH1g5GYhPw).
- One of my favorite crime TV shows, [Bosch](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/60585-bosch) {% primevideo "B089Y2TZSW" %} released its last season. It was a nice end, and I‚Äôll miss the TV show.
- I finally watched Wes Anderson‚Äôs [Isle of Dogs](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/399174-isle-of-dogs) {% netflix "80210680" %} which was a long time on my list. It‚Äôs an incredible stop-motion animated comedy.
- The _Academy of Ideas_ asked [Do We Live in a Brave New World? ‚Äì Aldous Huxley‚Äôs Warning to the World](https://youtu.be/aPkQ57cXrPA).
