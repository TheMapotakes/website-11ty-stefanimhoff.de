## Stuff & Things

- [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) ‚Äì I use the messenger a while already. Recommended by Edward Snowden, end-to-end encrypted, no ads, no tracking, open-source. Drop _WhatsApp_ and join!
- [Minds](https://www.minds.com/) ‚Äì I rediscovered this blockchain-based social network that is a mix of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. I had tried it in 2018 but stopped using it. In the meantime, it improved massively and the plans for 2021 look fantastic: Including the Matrix decentralized communication network, group chats, file sharing, e2e encryption, and much more. I started sharing things in I like in [my stream](https://www.minds.com/kogakure/) and had a much better exposure than on Twitter.
- [Session](https://getsession.org/) ‚Äì A nice new end-to-end open-source encrypted messenger based on the [Loki network](https://loki.network/) that uses no phone numbers, but instead a Session id, and is resistant to censorship or data breaches. It supported Group Chats, voice messages, attachments, and disappearing messages. All messages are routed through an onion routing network. [This is my Session ID](/downloads/session-id.txt).
- [The StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) ‚Äì A nice app to track your reading and choose the next book based on your mood and favorite topics and themes. It allows importing your Goodreads library. You can follow me [here](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/27a1bb49-a1e0-4eed-9465-457c42b51161).
- [Thinkspot](https://www.thinkspot.com) ‚Äì I stumbled on _Jordan Petersons_ anti-censorship social network service, he created in 2019. It‚Äôs still in beta but hosts interesting intellectual people and content.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) ‚Äì The Inter-Planetary File System is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol. I learned about it because [Brave integrated it this month into its browser](https://brave.com/brave-integrates-ipfs/). It‚Äôs a file-based decentralized internet that is fast and not possible to censor because you request files, not location addresses. It was used to make Wikipedia accessible again in Turkey after the government blocked access to the site. [DTube](https://d.tube/) is a video website, running on IPFS. I read through the documentation, watched [this](https://youtu.be/5Uj6uR3fp-U) and [this](https://youtu.be/N4RKKHSyZlk) video and plan on reading [The IPFS Primer](https://flyingzumwalt.gitbooks.io/decentralized-web-primer/).
- [This is Tulsi Gabbard](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/this-is-tulsi-gabbard/id1549623127) ‚Äì The new podcast of Tulsi Gabbard coming soon.
- [Facts Matter with Roman Balmakov](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuwhn5_41m4VxZJ3wcDyxA/) ‚Äì If you‚Äôre interested in US politics and want mostly unbiased and un-opinionated news coverage, this new channel by _The Epoch Times_ summarizes what happened 2-3 times a week.
