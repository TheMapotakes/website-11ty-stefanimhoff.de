## Stuff & Things

- [Ghost of Tsushima](https://www.playstation.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/) ‚Äì The new PlayStation exclusive game is Sony‚Äôs fasted-selling game of all times. And rightly so. It is incredibly good! The story is exciting and feels like being in a movie or more accurately in all Samurai movies ever produced at once. It has epic battles, deadly duels, and quiet moments while reflecting with Haiku, praying at a Shinto or Buddhist temple or shrine or while taking a bath in one of the many Onsen. Stunningly beautiful landscapes with falling cherry-blossom or maple tree leaves, endless grasslands, long sandy coastlines, dusty swamplands, or green bamboo forests. Directly next to battlefields with burned corpses, or landscapes and villages burned by the Mongol hordes. You can play with Japanese audio track for the right feeling and even enable Kurosawa mode (black and white with 60s audio) or play with the funny (but useless) photo mode to create videos or photos. The soundtrack was written by _Shigeru Umebayashi_.

- [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/) is a tool to test React Testing Library queries.
- [iA Writer Style Check](https://ia.net/writer/blog/introducing-style-check) ‚Äì My favorite text editor has now style check, a personal assistant that marks redundant words, clich√©s, and filler words as you type.
- [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/) ‚Äì Over 500 free, customizable SVG icons.
- [Element](https://element.io/) ‚Äì The decentralized, open-source chat tool Riot was renamed and landed a [huge deal of 350,000 seats for the German education system](https://sifted.eu/articles/element-germany-deal/). It runs on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@kogakure:matrix.org).
