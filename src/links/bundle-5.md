This will be interesting when over time more and more people will recognize YouTube and big news media outlets as what they are: Lying propaganda machines. And they get nervous, as the smear of [The Washington Post](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/strengthening-substack-journalism) shows. Glenn Greenwald leads through the article line by line to expose the [Online Censorship and The Washington Post’s Propaganda Tactics](hhttps://rumble.com/vl29vn-online-censorship-and-the-washington-posts-propaganda-tactics.html). Entertaining and educational.
