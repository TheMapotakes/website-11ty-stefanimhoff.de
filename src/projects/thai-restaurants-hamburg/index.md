I created this small website for three Thai restaurants in Hamburg in 2010. Of the more than **100** websites I created in my career, this one I still remember. It stayed online for nearly **10 years**.

I learned a lot about Graphic Design while working on it. I created the complete graphic by myself and learned how to design Gold items. I wanted to stay as true to Thai culture as possible and researched in-depth the colors and style of Thailand.

## Color Palette
