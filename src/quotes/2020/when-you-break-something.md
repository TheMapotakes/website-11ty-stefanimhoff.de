In _Superman: American Alien_ the young _Clark Kent_ is frustrated and destroys the mirror and wall behind it in a bathroom in a cinema. The next day his father is asking him, what he is thinking about:

> The Mirror. I was thinking … somebody had to make it, like somebody at the factory took time to make it. Then somebody had to sell it to the movie theater, and then other people had to fit it to the wall which somebody else built for them. When you break something, you’re not just breaking the thing, you’re like hurting every one who made it the way it was.
