Some really true words in this Tweet by **David Perell**. Some service in the cloud is just other peoples computers. If you want to own your publication and creative work, have your own website, and use open technologies. This tweet made me thinking about starting a monthly newsletter:

> Own your distribution. If you write online, focus on these two platforms:
>
> 1. Email.
> 2. Websites.
>
> Remember AOL? Remember MySpace? Remember Yahoo? Companies come and go but your email list and personal website will still be valuable in 10 years. Invest in the long-term.
