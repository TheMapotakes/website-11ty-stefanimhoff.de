Reading without processing the ideas is fruitless to _Arthur Schopenhauer_, as reading already takes over a huge amount of the work which is thinking.

> When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. [â€¦] This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid.
