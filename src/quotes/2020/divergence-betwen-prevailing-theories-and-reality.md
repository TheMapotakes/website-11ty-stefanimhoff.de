_Thomas Sowell_ about the simple truth that a society can’t survive if the beliefs of people diverge too far from the truth.

> There is only so much divergence between prevailing theories and intractable reality that a society can survive. Yet theories of equality are unlikely to be re-examined—or examined the first time—when they provide a foundation for the heady feeling of being morally superior to a benighted ‘society.’

> **Thomas Sowell**, _Quest for Cosmic Justice_
