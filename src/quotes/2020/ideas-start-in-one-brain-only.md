_Nick Law_, the Vice Chairman of R/GA talks about how it’s impossible to come up with an idea if you just do collective work in teams:

> We talk a lot about the connections, about the collaboration, and this space is built for it, but we’re also very mindful of these moments we just need to be left the fuck alone and get a clear mind and get laser. And so, there’s sort of this monkish piece and this sort of social piece and how those things work together is really the tension you’re dealing with because no one’s ever come up with a brilliant idea with 30 people in the room. It just doesn’t happen, you can refine an idea with five people in the room. But you’ve got to start with this sort of seed and I’ve never seen that seed appear, out of anything but one brain.
