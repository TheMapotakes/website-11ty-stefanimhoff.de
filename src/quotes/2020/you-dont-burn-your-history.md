_Daryl David_ collected over the years a lot of racist items, while he convinced dozens of Ku Klux Clan members to leave the clan:

> People always say to me, Daryl how can you have this stuff? Why don‘t you burn it? As shameful as it is, you don’t burn our history, regardless, the good, the bad, the ugly. And the Ku Klux Klan is as American as baseball, apple pie, and Chevrolet.
