_Jocko Willink_ on the [Joe Rogan Experience #1492 – Jocko Willink](https://youtu.be/bL5RzI5LyVc) about the danger of emotional reaction:

> No one makes good decisions when they are emotional. I spend my adult life trying to train humans to not get emotional in pressure situations. Why? Because it’s gonna end bad every single time. Every single time. And yet, that’s where our society is based on right now. It’s based on these emotional reactions.
