> Despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with the passage of the Civil Rights laws and ‘War on Poverty’ programs of the 1960s … the fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960 … Over the next 20 years, the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18 percentage points … This was the continuation of a previous economic trend, but at a slower rate of progress, it was not some economic grand deliverance.
