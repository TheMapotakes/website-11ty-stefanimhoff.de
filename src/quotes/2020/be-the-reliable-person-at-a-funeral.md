**Jordan B Peterson** about the fact that even a hard fate like the death of a loved ones offers an opportunity to be a role model and take over responsibility:

> You want to be the useful person at a funeral. […] You want to be the person on who’s shoulder people cry. […] It is really something to be the reliable person at a funeral.
>
