_Thomas Sowell_ is a huge opponent of _Affirmative Action_ as his numbers prove that it harms the Black community since more than 50 years. Interesting is what this Supreme Court Justice had to say to the topic:

> I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators … The Court … holds that racial discrimination in admissions should be given another 25 years … While I agree that in 25 years … [these] practices will be illegal, they are … illegal now.
>
> **Clarence Thomas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States**
