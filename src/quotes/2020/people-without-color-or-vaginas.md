A funny quote from the TV show [Community](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/18347-community), where _Britta Perry_ (Gillian Jacobs) does a speech about the importance of freedom of speech:

> <strong>Britta Perry:</strong> Weâ€™re talking about freedom of speech! It's the amendment so important it's literally the first one they remembered to add! <br /> <strong>Elroy Patashnik:</strong> For white people. <br /> <strong>Francesca Dart:</strong> With penises. <br /> <strong>Jeff Winger:</strong> We preferred to be called <strong>people without color or vaginas</strong>.
