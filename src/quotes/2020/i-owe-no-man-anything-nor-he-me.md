> I think it unnecessary to describe the Restorative Justice Handicapping System any further. I trust you find it thoroughly offensive, as I do. It, and the racist concept of restorative justice of which it is merely the concrete expression, is fundamentally contrary to the principles that govern, and should govern, our society. **I owe no man anything, nor he me, because of the blood that flows in our veins**.

> **Antonin Scalia, Supreme Court Justice**
