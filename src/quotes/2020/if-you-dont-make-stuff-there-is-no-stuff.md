_Elon Musk_ summarised on _Joe Rogan’s_ podcast, that governments, thinking they can just lock down the economy for unlimited time and solve the resulting crisis by printing money, won’t work:

> So, this notion that you can just sort of send out checks to everybody and things will be fine is not true. Obviously. There are some people that have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There is just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty, and then if somebody has more stuff it’s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. **Now let me just break it to you, the fools out there. If you don’t make stuff, there’s no stuff.** […] You can’t just legislate money and solve these things. If you don’t make stuff, there is no stuff. Obviously.
