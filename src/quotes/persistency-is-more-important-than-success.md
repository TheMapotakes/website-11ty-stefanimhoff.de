**Jordan B Peterson** about the fact that persistency is more important than success for habit change:

> You come, you have a problem, your life isn’t what it could be. Fine, let’s see what it could be like if we changed it. Well, figure out how to change it, that’s gonna be a negotiated dialogue. […] I can help you figure it out maybe, we can talk about it, but you are the person who has to decide if the things that you’re aiming for get you out of bed in the morning. […] And you have to understand that you gonna be bad at it, but it doesn’t matter, because bad is fine. **Persistent is what you need to be. If you persist with tiny improvements, you win.**
