_Ernest Hemingway_ writing in a letter to _Dorothy Connable_, as he was warning her about _Charles Fenton_, who spread misinformation about Hemingwayâ€™s life:

> The way to make people trustworthy is to trust them.
>
> **Ernest Hemingway**, _Ernest Hemingway Selected Letters 1917-1961_

The quote above is immediately followed by, <q>But this man is not a person that works with that system.</q>
