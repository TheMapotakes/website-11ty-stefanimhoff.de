> The academic Left, at the moment, seems to be routed essentially in semantics games, the redefinition of words in fact.
>
> And the Right, in my experience, and I’m not saying this exclusive or anything, actually just tends to use the Common English language definitions of words.

> And this is why it’s quite a pleasure to read someone like Thomas Sowell because he never has to redefine a word because he just uses it in the Common English parlance. Because he is not trying to be a pretentious academic about it, he trying to layout: <q>Look, this is the data, this is my interpretation of set data in a common-sense straightforward manner, do you find this persuasive?</q> […]
>
> Whereas the Left has come up with esoteric ways of looking at things: <q>Well, actually, let me tell you what the real definition of a woman is. Let me tell you what the real definition of a patriarchy is, let me tell you …</q>
>
> Wait, hang on a second, I didn’t agree to any of this _real_ re-definitions and I don’t agree with the final definition you come out with.
>
> The classic example being of course the definition of a woman. For a Right-winger, I guess somebody who isn’t politicized into the culture war, <q>a woman in the dictionary is an adult human female</q> which is a good and sensible definition. It has particular limits, essential characteristics, and it’s not self-referential. […]
>
> Well, the Left's version is: <q>A woman is anyone who identifies as a woman</q> which is actually a very concerning definition. […] <q>A woman is anyone who identifies as a woman is anyone who identifies as a woman is anyone …</q> So, you got this reoccurring loop in the definition of the word. So, the sentence is actually never completed. […]
>
> It gives us no information about what a woman actually is other than some kind of being that identifies as this empty word. […] The important thing is also what’s excluded from the word, because if you take out the word adult from the definition of a woman, what you’re saying is that non-adults, and maybe even non-humans – if you take out the human part – could identify as women.
