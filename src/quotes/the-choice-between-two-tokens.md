> Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice between two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says <q>It’s no big deal</q> or the token that says <q>It’s the end of the world</q>. Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other.
