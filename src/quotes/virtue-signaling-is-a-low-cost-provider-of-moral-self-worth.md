> There is no financial cost to the individual in intersectionality as commonly practiced. One can feel good by tweeting about historical slavery on a smartphone whose battery contains Cadmium mined by some of the world’s forty million current slaves, but it is not required either that one sacrifice one’s technology in solidarity with them, or seek to change their status, as previous generations of Christians did. Ironically, given the Marxist background of many of its adherents, intersectionality is that most capitalist of phenomena: a low-cost provider of moral self-worth.
