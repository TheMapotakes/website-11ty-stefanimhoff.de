_Colin Wright_ about the sad truth that ideology prevents scientific progress in a lot of scientific areas.

> But it seems clear to me that academia now is not as it was advertised a decade ago when I started down this path. It is no longer a refuge for outspoken, free-thinking intellectuals. Instead, it seems one must now choose between living a zipper-lipped life as an academic scientist or living a life as a fulfilled intellectual. Currently, one cannot do both.
