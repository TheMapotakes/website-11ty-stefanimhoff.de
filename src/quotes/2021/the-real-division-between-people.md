The real division and conflict are not between Liberals and Conservatives as we always hear in the media. It is between those who want a strong, central government that controls the life of its citizens on the one side and those who want a transparent, slim government and strong, self-reliant citizens on the other side.

> The real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.
>
> **George Orwell**

Those two views of life are not compatible and will always conflict. You can find out what you are with [The Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) test.

In a News Conference in 1986 _Ronald Reagan_ said probably the most famous quote for every Libertarian:

> The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: <q>I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.</q>

> **Ronald Reagan**, [The President’s News Conference](https://youtu.be/nCedOQJ0ZEA), August 12, 1986
