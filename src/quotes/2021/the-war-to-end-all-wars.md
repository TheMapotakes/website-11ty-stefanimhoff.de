> After the second world war, for example, there were many who believed that by achieving victory over the Nazis we also achieved victory over the Evil they represented, which unfortunately isn’t the case. But it goes to show that there is a fine line between recognizing a real threat to one’s self or community and using that threat to delude ourselves into believing that we can erase the shadow of our own light by violently putting out someone else’s. It’s a delusion that often reveals itself through promises like; if only these threats are eliminated, our freedoms will be protected. If only these enemies are destroyed, we will bring honor a justice to our nation. If only we end this war, we will end them all.
