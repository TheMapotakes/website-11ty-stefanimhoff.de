**Jordan B Peterson** on how important it is for a person to let others reach independence. Keeping a person dependent is toxic, oedipal behavior:

> That’s the oedipal mother. <q>I forgive you no matter what you do</q>. Really? No matter what I do? You are not my friend. That’s for sure. Not at all. It’s a horrible thing to do to someone. […] That’s the oedipal mother, that’s one of Freud’s major discoveries. […] The devouring force of love. You want the person to be able to stand on their own and the price you pay for that is that you stand on your own.
