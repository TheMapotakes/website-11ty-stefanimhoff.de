> <q>You see this goblet?</q> asks Achaan Chaa, the Thai meditation master. <q>For me this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, <q>Of course.</q> When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.</q>
