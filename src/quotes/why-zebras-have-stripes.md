**Jordan B Peterson** explains why Zebras have stripes: Not to camouflage against the environment but the herd. Lions are not able to target individual Zebras when they stay with the herd. He uses this as an analogy to explain similar human behavior:

> The rule for human beings is: Keep your damn stripes on, so the lions don’t get you. […] If you want to remember one thing from my class about human motivation that’s a good thing to learn: People camouflage themselves against the herd. And they like to be in the middle of the herd […] That’s what people are trying to do all the time.
