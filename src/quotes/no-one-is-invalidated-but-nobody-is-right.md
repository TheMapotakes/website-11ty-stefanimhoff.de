The game _Metal Gear Solid 2_ predicted nearly 20 years ago quite accurately the world we live in. A world where no truth exists, just _My Truth_ and _Your Truth_ instead of **The Truth**.

I’ve seen many wrong statements retweeted by the people I follow on social media that the only explanations are filter bubbles, groupthink, and the laziness of finding out the truth.

> The untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and accumulate … No one is invalidated, but nobody is right. Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is being engulfed in ‘truth.’ And this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper.
