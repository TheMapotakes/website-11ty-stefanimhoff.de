**Jordan B Peterson** explains the Oedipal mother from Sigmund Freud’s theory: A person in co-dependence trying to keep others dependent:

> <q>I love my child, I love my mother, so much that I couldn’t survive should anything happen to them. </q> It’s like you … have some serious thinking to do about that! You really want to curse someone with that kind of love? <q>I couldn’t live without you</q>. My god, get away from me! Really, it’s terrible!
>
