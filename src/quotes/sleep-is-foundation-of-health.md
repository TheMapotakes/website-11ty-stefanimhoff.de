> I was once fond of saying: <q>Sleep is the third pillar of good health, alongside diet and exercise.</q> I have changed my tune. Sleep is more than a pillar; it is the foundation on which the other two health bastions sit. Take away the bedrock of sleep, or weaken it just a little, and careful eating or physical exercise become less than effective.
