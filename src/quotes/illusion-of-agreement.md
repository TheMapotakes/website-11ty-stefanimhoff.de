_Jason Fried_ on the _Illusion of Agreement_. Be precise in your communication and don’t assume two sides have the same understanding of an issue.

> Next time you’re discussing something with someone — inside or outside your organization — and you find the outcome contingent upon a relative term or phrase, be sure to clarify it. If they say expedited, you say <q>we need it tomorrow morning, October 3</q>. Expedited is relative, and overnight can be too depending on where someone’s shipping something from, what time zone they’re in, etc. Get concrete, get it in writing, and get complete clarity. Slam the door shut on interpretation, and open the door to assuredness.
