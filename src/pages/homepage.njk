  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <div class="homepage-what-i-do-text">
    <p>
      I create and build beautiful, user-centric layouts for devices of all
      sizes on the web for nearly two decades and love bringing simplicity and
      minimalism to everything&nbsp;I&nbsp;create.
    </p>
    <p>
      I deeply care about good user experience: Writing good text, choosing the
      right photography, typography, and colors. Programming fast, reusable,
      well-tested, and easy-to-maintain code or creating
      engaging&nbsp;animations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working at
      <a href="https://www.xing.com/">XING</a>, the biggest business network in
      Europe, working on the Design&nbsp;System.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love innovating: During multiple
      <a href="https://medium.com/xing-hackweek">Hackweeks</a> I was part of a
      small team creating a completely new job platform for freelancers. I am
      also a three-time winner of the <em>Prototyping Days</em>, a yearly
      two-day company-wide prototyping&nbsp;event.
